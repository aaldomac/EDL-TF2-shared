# IMPLEMENTATION OF EDL IN TENSORFLOW 2 #

This repository contains the implementation developed by [Sensoy et al., 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.01768)
by migrating the official code [official repository](https://muratsensoy.github.io/uncertainty.html) in Tensorflow 2.

Inside EDL folder there are all the modules needed for the Evidential Deep Learning framework to work and the EDL_script.py
file that runs the framework with the mse loss.
